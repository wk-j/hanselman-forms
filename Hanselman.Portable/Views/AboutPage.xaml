               Text="Weigel started working as a model after moving to Bangkok in 2010. The next year, she turned her attention to singing. Following three months of training, she entered a national televised singing contest for children, called Singing Kids, and won third place.[3] From there, she became an artist trainee at GMM Grammy in October 2012 before becoming a full artist under it.[2]
In 2012, during her trainee period, she appeared in the music video of Getsunova's 'Klai Khae Nai Khue Klai' (ไกลแค่ไหนคือใกล้; 'How Much Further Is It Till I Could Be Near You?'), which brought her to fame.[2] In 2013, she started her YouTube channel where she publishes, amongst other things, her covers of popular songs. Many of the covers went viral and gained many million views.[1]
In 2015, Weigel released her first single, 'Chak Din Chak Ngo', followed by a number of OST songs.[2] In the same year, she was given the main roles in the television series Banlang Mek and the film Senior.[2][5] In 2016, she issued her second single, 'Away'.[6]"
